### Description
The purpose of this proposal is to gain funding for further analysis, planning, permitting, and building a bike-share service for Des Moines, Iowa, similar in style to the Citi Bike program in New York City.

### Benefits of a Bike-sharing Service
Wilmington, DE recently produced a feasibility study on a bike-share service for their city (https://www.wilmingtonde.gov/government/city-departments/planning-and-development/bike-wilmington/bike-share-feasibility-study), and cited the following benefits:
+ Increased mobility and connectivity
+ Complement to existing transit services by offering a first and last-mile option
+ An increase in the bicycling participation rate
+ Possible funding from Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for bike stations if within a 3-mile radius of transit
+ Bike share recognized by many cities as a means for attracting or retaining residents, students, and workforce talent
+ Reduced transportation costs for individuals
+ A positive economic impact in commercial areas surrounding bike share stations
+ Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing trips taken previously by automobile
+ Improved health for participants
+ Increased ridership reduces the risk of being struck by a motorist – "safety in numbers effect."
The key to success for the bike share service will be gaining support from the local government, businesses, and community. Increasing support for enhanced bicycle safety communications, improved safety measures such as dedicated bicycle lanes, and the placement of bicycle stations in strategic areas will help drive participation rates.

### Citi Bike Overview
As part of our discovery process for this proposal, we analyzed the August 2019 data for the Citi Bike service.
#### Key Findings
![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/nyc_map.png "Citi Bike Stations and Volumes")
There are close to 800 bike stations and almost 14,000 bicycles in the Citi Bike service.  The trip data for August 2019 shows that stations near transportation hubs and tourist attractions have the greatest activity.

![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/nyc_customers_aug_2019.png "Trips and Customers")

There were over 2.3M trips in August 2019.  Subscribers accounted for over 80% of the trip volume with 1.9M rides.  The August 2019 Monthly Operating Report (https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/nyc/August-2019-Citi-Bike-Monthly-Report.pdf?mtime=20191217092445) listed the annual subscriber count at 154K.  The average subscriber had 12 trips during the month.  Customers purchased 286K single trip, single day, or three day passes and accounted for 444K trips in August or 1.5 rides per customer.  When gender is known – males account for 72% of activity.    The highest ride volumes are coming from people born in the 1980s and 1990s.

Peak hours for Citi Bike occur during the prime commuting hours in the morning and late afternoon/evening.  Customers are replacing other transportation with the bike-sharing service for their commute or using it as a first-mile/last-mile option in conjunction with their public or private transportation options.

![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/nyc_trip_duration.png "Trip Duration")
The average trip duration for August was 15.4 minutes meaning most riders are using the service to travel approximately two miles.  Casual rider trip duration is 26 minutes on average, double subscriber average duration of 13 minutes.

![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/nyc_weather_and_rides.png "Weather and Rides")

When charting ride volume alongside precipitation data by day (sourced from https://www.accuweather.com/), it becomes apparent that weather does impact ride volumes.  Trip count for days with precipitation are 9.5% lower on average than days without rain.

Ride volumes are highest Thursday through Saturday, with casual rider volumes picking up as subscriber activity drops.

### How does Des Moines compare to New York City?
#### Population – how will it affect usage?

![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/population.png "Population")

Based on census data available from https://www.census.gov/, the population of Des Moines is approximately 217K, which is equivalent to 2.6% of New York City's population of 8.4M people.  New York has 154K active annual members of the Citi Bike service or 1.8% of its people.  Assuming that we can expect the same type of participation level in Des Moines, we would expect approximately 4K residents to be members of our annual subscription.

![](https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/des_moines_pop_demographics.png "Des Moines Population Demographics")
55.9% of Des Moines population is 20-59 years old – a key demographic for cycling participation.  51.3% of Des Moines population is female – a full percentage point lower than New York City's 52.3%.  The greater weighting of males in Des Moines may contribute to a higher participation rate compared to New York.

Females represent an excellent opportunity to increase participation significantly.  A study cited in http://peopleforbikes.org/ found that women are more sensitive to the absence of bike lanes and trails.  According to the Des Moines tourism site and Central Iowa Trails, there are over 600 miles of paved trails in the area.  Another study cited the Twin Cities' success in driving the nation's highest rate of women bicyclists, between 37-45%, due to increases in local bicycling infrastructure.  Partnering with the local government to increase dedicated bike lanes will increase overall participation, but particularly with the female population.

#### Tourism’s Impact
![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/tourism.png "Tourism")

According to research by Longwoods International, commissioned by the Des Moines tourism site Catch Des Moines, annual visitors reached 13.7M.  WYSE Travel Confederation cited New York City's yearly tourists at 62.8M.  Although the population of Des Moines is 2.6% of New York's, Des Moines' tourism is equivalent to 21.8% of New York's.  The tourist level in Des Moines represents an excellent opportunity for casual rider participation.

Casual riders purchased 286K ride share passes in August 2019.  The average monthly tourists for New York is 5.2M.  Customer purchases are 5.5% of the monthly tourist count.  Assuming we achieve similar ratios of casual rides per tourist in Des Moines, we can expect approximately 62K passes sold.  Tourism will play a more significant role in bike share activity compared to annual subscribers in Des Moines than what we see in New York.

#### What about the weather?

![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/weather_comparison.png "Weather Comparison")

Comparing average temperature and days with precipitation (sourced from https://www.noaa.gov/), New York and Des Moines have similar weather.  Des Moines is colder than New York on average from November through February, but otherwise, they are relatively aligned.  The colder weather may adversely impact participation compared to New York, but the fewer days of precipitation during the same period may help offset the difference.  Overall, we expect to see similar ridership trends by month between the two cities.

#### Choosing the right sites is a key to success
![]( https://github.com/kenwelsh/bikesharing/blob/master/Images/des_moines_map.png "Des Moines Map")

New City has almost 800 bike stations and 14,000 bikes to handle the 154K subscribers and 286K casual riders using the Citi Bike service.  Using population and tourist data to extrapolate potential usage in Des Moines, we estimate we will need 45-50 bike stations and 850-900 bikes in the system.  The ratio of user type more heavily weighted toward casual riders in Des Moines, as well as differences in transportation options, will impact site placement and marketing.  Potential sites will include:
+ Tourist attractions/points of interest
+ Hotels
+ Parking facilities
+ Parks and bike trails
+ Public transit routes
+ Shopping centers/malls
+ Universities and colleges
+ Business districts
+ Areas with a high population concentration

### Conclusion
Bike share services bring many benefits to the communities they serve.  Each city brings its opportunities and challenges.  Careful planning and execution with the local government, businesses, and society, as well as appropriate monitoring and adaptation, will lead to a healthier environment and successful program.  Investing in a bike-sharing service is an investment in a better future.
